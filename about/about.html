          InspireMe was founded by me Prince Ea. Born and raised on the North Side of St. Louis Missouri, I graduated
          Magna Cum Laude from a full scholarship at the University of Missouri St. Louis, with my BA in Anthropology.
          Over a decade ago, I was making music with grand ambitions of gaining respect, being named the best rapper of
          all time and performing in front of thousands of fans. This egoic pursuit caused a lot of suffering. I began
          to compare myself with other musicians that were "further along" than I was and this caused much internal
          pain.
          <br>
          <br>
          The suffering and unhappiness was so much that I stopped making music and decided that I simply wanted to be
          happy. This is when I began to read ancient and modern texts on spirituality. I became enthralled in
          everything from the Baghavad Gita to the Tao te Ching. Through literature and introspection, I realized that
          "doing" will never make me happy, it is only in "being" where happiness and peace arises.
          <br>
          <br>
          Another Huge Realization was of the limited number of breaths that each of us is to take on this planet. This
          realization of the brevity of life was what led me to create Inspire ME. I am grateful for every moment, every
          unrepeatable miracle, and while I am here I want to help the real-life heroes to reach every single heart on
          the planet to show them that at our core we are Love, we are free, and we are one.
          <br>
